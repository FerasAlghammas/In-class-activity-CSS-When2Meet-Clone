    <h2>About Hamster</h2> 
    <p><em><strong>Hamsters</strong></em> are rodents (order Rodentia) belonging to the subfamily <strong>Cricetinae</strong>, which contains 19 species classified in seven genera. They have become established as popular small pets. The best-known species of hamster is the <span style="color :gold">golden or Syrian hamster  </span><sub>(Mesocricetus auratus)</sub>, which is the type most commonly kept as a pet.</p>
    <p>Other hamster species commonly kept as pets are the three species of dwarf hamster, <span style = "color:gray">Campbell's dwarf hamster</span><sup>(Phodopus campbelli)</sup>, the winter white dwarf hamster (Phodopus sungorus), and the<strong> <span style = "color:burlywood">Roborovski hamster</span></strong> <sup>(Phodopus roborovskii)</sup>.</p>
    <p>Hamsters are more crepuscular than nocturnal and, in the wild, remain underground during the day to avoid being caught by predators. They are most active at dawn and dusk, a behavior that helps them avoid the heat of the day and potential threats.</p>
    <p>They feed primarily on seeds, fruits, and vegetation, and will occasionally eat burrowing insects. This omnivorous diet helps them thrive in various environments, where food sources may be scarce or seasonal.</p>
    <p>Physically, hamsters are stout-bodied with distinguishing features that include elongated cheek pouches extending to their shoulders, which they use to carry food back to their burrows. They also have a short tail and fur-covered feet, which are well adapted for their burrowing lifestyle.</p>
